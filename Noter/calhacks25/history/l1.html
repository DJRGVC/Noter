                <h2>Introduction & Course Context</h2>
                
                <p>This lecture explores the intersection of medieval literature, fantasy writing, and 20th-century intellectual history through the works of <span class="highlight">J.R.R. Tolkien</span> and <span class="highlight">C.S. Lewis</span>. The discussion examines how these Oxford scholars drew upon medieval sources to create modern fantasy literature that resonated deeply with post-World War audiences.</p>

                    <div class="callout-title">🎯 Central Question</div>
                    <p>How do we reconcile the accessible medieval world of Tolkien and Lewis with the disturbing medieval spirituality explored by Caroline Walker Bynum? What aspects of medieval culture have been transmitted to modern audiences, and which have been left behind?</p>

                <h3>Student Familiarity with the Material</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Narnia Series:</strong> Most students read it in childhood, though memories are vague</li>
                        <li><strong>Lord of the Rings:</strong> Nearly universal familiarity with both books and films</li>
                        <li><strong>The Hobbit:</strong> Widely read, though some found LOTR's style too dense</li>
                        <li><strong>C.S. Lewis's Theological Works:</strong> Limited exposure (The Great Divorce, some awareness of Screwtape Letters)</li>

                    <p>Cantor characterizes both authors as "uneven" and dismisses their work as overly pessimistic and juvenile. Students strongly disagreed with this assessment, finding Lewis particularly uplifting in his emphasis on human choice and redemption.</p>

                <h2>Lewis's Medieval Model</h2>

                <p>In <em>The Discarded Image</em>, C.S. Lewis presents a comprehensive view of the medieval worldview—a systematic, coherent model of the universe that medieval people subscribed to with remarkable consistency.</p>

                <h3>Key Characteristics of the Medieval Model</h3>

                <div class="comparison-grid">
                    <div class="comparison-card">
                        <h4>📚 Bookish</h4>
                        <p>Medieval culture was intensely literary, valuing written authorities above empirical observation. If it was written by an authority, it was believed.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-card">
                        <h4>🔄 Systematic</h4>
                        <p>Medieval thinkers worked tirelessly to reconcile contradictory sources, creating comprehensive systems. Lewis jokes they would have loved the card index.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-card">
                        <h4>🌍 Eclectic</h4>
                        <p>The model incorporated pagan, Christian, poetic, and historical sources without discrimination, attempting to "save all appearances."</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-card">
                        <h4>🎭 Cosmological</h4>
                        <p>A complete worldview including planetary spheres, humoral theory, celestial intelligences, and the music of the spheres.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Student Accessibility to Medieval Concepts</h3>

                <div class="discussion">
                    <p class="speaker">Class Discussion Highlights:</p>
                    <p><strong>Familiar concepts:</strong> References to Mars (war), Jove (Jupiter/authority), planetary influences, and humoral theory (choleric, melancholic) were somewhat recognizable to students.</p>
                    <p><strong>Unfamiliar territory:</strong> Most students had never read Chaucer, Dante, or other medieval sources Lewis references extensively. This created a barrier to fully appreciating his examples.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> One student noted that Lewis's model felt "familiar" in a way Bynum's work did not—suggesting this version of medieval culture has been more successfully transmitted to modern audiences.</p>

                        "Though neither statement can be taken literally, it does not follow that it makes no difference which is used.

                <h3>The Nature of Truth: Medieval vs. Modern</h3>

                <p>A fascinating class debate emerged about whether mathematical and physical laws are <span class="highlight">"true" with a capital T</span>—eternally and universally true, or merely useful models that describe observations.</p>

                <div class="comparison-grid">
                    <div class="comparison-card">
                        <h4>Platonist View</h4>
                        <p>Math is eternally true; we discover pre-existing truths. Physical laws tap into ultimate reality. (Some students held this view)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-card">
                        <h4>Instrumentalist View</h4>
                        <p>Math and physics are tools for modeling reality, not Truth itself. Models change as we learn more. (More common among science students)</p>

                    <div class="callout-title">🔬 Implications for Understanding Medieval Thought</div>
                    <p>If you believe modern physics describes eternal Truth, medieval cosmology seems simply <em>wrong</em>. But if you view all models as provisional tools, the medieval model becomes just another way of organizing observations—not inferior, merely different.</p>

            <section id="bynum-comparison" class="content-section">
                <h2>Reconciling Bynum with Lewis and Tolkien</h2>

                <p>The previous week's reading of Caroline Walker Bynum's work on medieval women's spirituality deeply disturbed students with its focus on extreme asceticism, self-starvation, and bodily suffering. How does this relate to the medieval world of Tolkien and Lewis?</p>

                <div class="callout callout-warning">
                    <div class="callout-title">⚠️ The Bynum Problem</div>
                    <p>Bynum's medieval world—focused on female mystics, extreme fasting, stigmata, and bodily suffering—feels alien and disturbing to modern readers. Yet it's based on the same historical period as Tolkien's romanticized medieval world.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Lewis's Solution: Separate Spheres</h3>

                <p>Lewis argues (page 18 of <em>The Discarded Image</em>) that medieval cosmology and Christian theology occupied <span class="highlight">separate mental spaces</span>:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "One particular class of experts, the great spiritual writers, ignore the model almost completely. We need to know something about the model to read Chaucer, but we can neglect it if we're going to read Saint Bernard."
                </blockquote>

                <p>The paradox: The cosmological model <em>appears</em> intensely religious (spheres moved by love of God, celestial intelligences, etc.), yet Lewis insists it's <strong>not eminently Christian</strong>. It's theistic but not specifically Christian theology.</p>

                <div class="discussion">
                    <p class="speaker">Class Debate:</p>
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Can we really believe medieval people kept these spheres completely separate?</p>
                    <p><strong>Modern analogy:</strong> Students noted that many scientists today are Christians who accept evolution at work but believe in Biblical creation on Sunday—suggesting such compartmentalization is possible.</p>
                    <p><strong>Counter-argument:</strong> The medieval model seems too integrated with religious imagery to be truly separate from faith.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>A Possible Reconciliation</h3>

                <div class="callout callout-success">
                    <div class="callout-title">✅ Hypothesis</div>
                    <p><strong>Tolkien's Middle-earth</strong> draws from the <em>cosmological/cultural</em> medieval model—the one that's been transmitted through literature and feels accessible.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bynum's medieval world</strong> represents the <em>intensely Christian/spiritual</em> sphere—the "real deal" of medieval religious experience that hasn't been transmitted to modern popular culture.</p>
                    <p>This explains why one feels familiar (and spawns billion-dollar film franchises) while the other feels alien and disturbing.</p>

                <p>World War I shattered traditional notions of heroism. The contrast between medieval heroic literature and modern mechanized warfare became a central tension for both Tolkien and Lewis.</p>

                <p>To understand what Tolkien was working with (and against), we must examine the Anglo-Saxon heroic ideal as embodied in <em>Beowulf</em>.</p>

                <h3>Beowulf's Heroic Characteristics</h3>

                <div class="comparison-grid">
                    <div class="comparison-card">

                <div class="literary-quote">
                    <p>"Now is the time when I would have wanted to bestow this armor on my own son, had it been my fortune to have fathered an heir and live on in his flesh. For fifty years, I ruled this nation. No king of any neighboring clan would dare face me with troops... All this consoles me, doomed as I am and sickening for death. Because of my right ways, the ruler of mankind need never blame me when the breath leaves my body for murder of kinsmen."</p>
                    <div class="quote-source">— Beowulf's dying speech</div>
                </div>

                <p>Beowulf's final request: that Wiglaf retrieve treasure from the dragon's hoard so he can gaze upon it before dying. This seems strange to modern readers but is essential to the heroic mode—<span class="highlight">dying with treasure in sight validates the hero's sacrifice</span>.</p>

                <h3>The Anti-Heroic Undertone</h3>

                <p>Yet even <em>Beowulf</em> contains seeds of doubt about heroism:</p>

                <p>The poem ends not with triumph but with a <span class="highlight">wailing woman's lament</span>: Without Beowulf, the Geats are doomed. Old feuds will resurface. The Swedes will attack. Everyone will die.</p>

                <h2>The Lord of the Rings: Anti-Heroes and Unlikely Saviors</h2>

                <p>Tolkien's masterwork fundamentally reimagines the nature of heroism, creating a dual narrative that contrasts traditional and modern heroic modes.</p>

                <h3>Who Is the Hero?</h3>

                <div class="discussion">
                    <p class="speaker">Class Debate:</p>
                    <p><strong>Aragorn?</strong> He fits the traditional mold—noble lineage, warrior-king, wins the girl and the kingdom. The classical hero.</p>
                    <p><strong>Frodo and Sam?</strong> They are the <em>anti-heroes</em>—small, weak, unimportant hobbits who save the world through suffering and sacrifice, not martial prowess.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tolkien's choice:</strong> The book could have ended with Aragorn's coronation (the heroic ending), but instead continues through the Scouring of the Shire and Frodo's departure—emphasizing the anti-heroic narrative.</p>

                <h3>The Unsung Hero of WWI</h3>

                <p>Students connected Frodo's fate to the WWI veteran experience:</p>

                <ul class="summary-list">
                    <li>Returns home to a world that doesn't understand what he's been through</li>

                    <li>Cannot reintegrate into normal life</li>
                    <li>Carries wounds (physical and psychological) that never heal</li>
                    <li>Must eventually "depart" from the world he saved</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Scouring of the Shire (cut from the films) reinforces this: even home has been corrupted, and the hobbits must fight to reclaim it—just as veterans returned to a changed world.</p>

                        <li><strong>Rejection of power:</strong> "Gains the whole world and throws it away"</li>
                        <li><strong>Redemption through weakness:</strong> Strength through vulnerability, not might</li>

                <h2>Christianity, Conversion, and the Medieval Mind</h2>

                <p>The tension between pagan heroism and Christian values runs throughout medieval literature and deeply influenced both Tolkien and Lewis.</p>

                <h3>The Venerable Bede: Converting Edwin of Northumbria</h3>

                <p>Bede's <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> (early 8th century) provides a fascinating account of how Anglo-Saxon kings were converted to Christianity. The story reveals medieval attitudes toward life, death, and the unknown.</p>

                <div class="literary-quote">
                    <p><strong>The Chief Priest speaks:</strong> "Your majesty, let us give careful consideration to this new teaching, for I frankly admit that in my experience, the religion that we have hitherto professed seems valueless and powerless. None of your subjects has been more devoted to the service of our gods than myself. Yet there are many to whom you show greater favor... If the gods had any power, they would surely have favored myself, who have been more zealous in their service."</p>

                </div>

                <h3>The Sparrow Parable</h3>

                <div class="callout callout-quote">
                    <div class="callout-title">🕊️ Life as a Sparrow's Flight</div>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Your majesty, when we compare the present life of man on earth with that time of which we have no knowledge, it seems to me like the swift flight of a single sparrow through the banqueting hall where you are sitting at dinner on a winter's day... The sparrow flies swiftly in through one door of the hall and out through another. While he is inside, he is safe from the winter storms. But after a few moments of comfort, he vanishes from sight into the wintry world from which he came. Even so, man appears on earth for a little while, but of what went before this life or of what follows, we know nothing. Therefore, if this new teaching has brought any more certain knowledge, it seems only right that we should follow it."
                        <div class="quote-source">— Bede's counselor to King Edwin</div>
                    </blockquote>
                </div>

                <p>This parable perfectly captures the <span class="highlight">existential uncertainty</span> of pagan Anglo-Saxon life—the same uncertainty that haunts Beowulf's ending.</p>

                <h3>Frodo's Departure: A Christian Resolution</h3>

                <p>Contrast the sparrow's flight into unknown darkness with Frodo's departure into the West:</p>

                <div class="callout callout-info">
                    <div class="callout-title">🎯 Key Insight</div>
                    <p>Tolkien provides a <span class="highlight">Christianized heroic ending</span>: Frodo suffers and sacrifices (Christian), but unlike Beowulf, he doesn't face the unknown alone. He has assurance of a good destination, even if he doesn't know the specifics. This resolves the pagan hero's existential terror while maintaining the anti-heroic mode.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Silmarillion: Creation Through Song</h3>

                <p>Students noted that Tolkien's creation myth (detailed in <em>The Silmarillion</em>) draws heavily on medieval Christian cosmology:</p>

                <ul class="summary-list">
                    <li>God (Ilúvatar) creates through divine beings (Ainur) who sing the world into existence</li>
                    <li>Echoes Boethius's <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em>: philosophy comes through celestial song</li>
                    <li>Connects to Lewis's medieval model: the music of the spheres, harmony of creation</li>
                    <li>Explains Tolkien's love of lyric poetry throughout LOTR</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Tolkien isn't just writing fantasy—he's writing <span class="highlight">quasi-medieval chronicle</span>, complete with the theological underpinnings of medieval cosmology.</p>

                    <p>The Dead Marshes in <em>The Two Towers</em>—where corpses lie face-up in water, preserved but unreachable—directly mirror WWI trench warfare.

                </div>

                <h3>Escape and Memory</h3>

                <p>Students debated whether Tolkien and Lewis were "escaping" from their traumatic present into an idealized past:</p>

                <div class="callout callout-info">
                    <div class="callout-title">🤔 The Escape Question</div>
                    <p><strong>Yes, it's escape:</strong> They're creating alternative worlds where heroism is still possible, where individual action matters, where there's meaning in sacrifice.</p>
                    <p><strong>No, it's processing:</strong> They're working through trauma by placing it in a context where it can be understood. The violence is still there (LOTR is incredibly violent), but it has meaning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Both:</strong> Creating worlds they can control while still grappling with memories they can't escape. The Dead Marshes exist alongside the Shire.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Braudel Comparison</h3>

                <p>Like Fernand Braudel (discussed in previous lectures), Tolkien and Lewis respond to catastrophic war by reaching into the past:</p>

                <ul class="summary-list">
                    <li><strong>Braudel:</strong> WWII POW experience → writes about Mediterranean in 16th century, emphasizing geography over politics</li>
                    <li><strong>Tolkien:</strong> WWI veteran → writes about Middle-earth, emphasizing small heroes and the importance of home</li>
                    <li><strong>Lewis:</strong> WWI veteran → writes about Narnia and medieval cosmology, emphasizing moral choice and redemption</li>
                </ul>

                <p>All three are <span class="highlight">pioneers through nostalgia</span>—creating new forms (Annales history, modern fantasy) by deeply engaging with the past.</p>

                    <p>"I am not aware that any of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects, and therefore cannot claim to be Aryan.</p>
                    <p>However, if I am to understand that you are inquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, <strong>I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people</strong>.</p>
                    <p>[...] I have been accustomed to regard my German name with pride and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war [WWI]. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that <span class="highlight">if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride</span>."</p>

                    <p><strong>Moral clarity in 1938:</strong> Many claimed they "didn't know" what was happening in Germany. Tolkien knew exactly what was happening and condemned it unequivocally.</p>
                    <p><strong>Personal cost:</strong> His German name and Germanic scholarship, once sources of pride, were being tainted by association with Nazism.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defiant solidarity:</strong> He expresses regret at not having Jewish ancestry—a remarkable statement in 1938.</p>

                <h3>The Irony of Race in LOTR</h3>

                <p>Students noted the irony: Tolkien's work <em>celebrates</em> different races (Elves, Dwarves, Men, Hobbits), each with distinct characteristics and cultures. Yet this is fundamentally different from Nazi racial ideology:</p>

                        <li><strong>Two Medieval Worlds:</strong> Lewis and Tolkien draw from the cosmological/cultural medieval model (accessible, transmitted through literature), while Bynum explores the intensely Christian/spiritual sphere (alien to modern readers)</li>
                        <li><strong>Heroism Transformed:</strong> WWI shattered traditional heroic modes; Tolkien responds by creating anti-heroes (Frodo, Sam) who save through suffering rather than martial prowess</li>
                        <li><strong>Christian Resolution:</strong> Unlike pagan heroes (Beowulf) who face death's uncertainty, Tolkien's heroes have Christian assurance—they don't know details but trust they're in good hands</li>
                        <li><strong>Race and Culture:</strong> Tolkien had a "burning private grudge" against Hitler for perverting Germanic culture; his work reclaims the "noble northern spirit" in its true, Christianized form</li>
                        <li><strong>History as Fiction, Fiction as History:</strong> The line between Tolkien's fantasy and Braudel's history is thin—both are responses to catastrophic war, both reach into the past to make sense of the present</li>

                <p>This lecture demonstrates how <span class="highlight">literature and history are inseparable from their cultural moment</span>.
