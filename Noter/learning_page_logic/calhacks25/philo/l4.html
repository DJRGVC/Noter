                    <p>How do we reconcile the accessible, popular medieval fantasy of Tolkien and Lewis with the disturbing, visceral medieval Christianity explored by Caroline Walker Bynum?</p>
                </div>

                <p>This lecture explores the fascinating intersection between medieval scholarship and 20th-century fantasy literature, focusing on how <span class="highlight">J.R.R. Tolkien</span> and <span class="highlight">C.S. Lewis</span> transformed their academic understanding of medieval culture into literary works that continue to resonate today.</p>

                <h2>Lewis's Medieval Model</h2>

                <p>In <em>The Discarded Image</em>, C.S. Lewis presents a comprehensive model of the medieval worldview characterized by three key features:</p>

                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <div class="concept-card">
                        <h4>📚 Bookish</h4>
                        <p>Medieval thinkers wanted to believe everything written by authorities, creating a vast web of textual knowledge.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="concept-card">
                        <h4>🔄 Systematic</h4>
                        <p>They sought to reconcile all different sources into a coherent whole—"if there was an invention they would have appreciated, it was the card index."</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="concept-card">
                        <h4>🌍 Eclectic</h4>
                        <p>They drew from pagan, Christian, poetic, and historical sources without seeing contradiction.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>On the imaginative and emotional level, it makes a great difference whether, with the medievals, we project upon the universe our strivings and desires or with the moderns, our police system and our traffic regulations.</p>
                    <div class="quote-author">— C.S. Lewis, The Discarded Image, p. 94</div>
                </div>

                <h3>The Gravity Example</h3>

                <p>Lewis contrasts medieval and modern understandings through the example of a falling stone:</p>

                <div class="discussion-point">
                    <div class="speaker">Medieval View:</div>
                    <p>If I'm a stone, I'm heavy, and I desperately want to be where I belong, which is on the earth. So if somebody drops me off a tower, I'm going to get as quickly as I possibly can back to earth.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="discussion-point">
                    <div class="speaker">Modern View:</div>
                    <p>The "gravity police" jump out and command the stone to fall according to mathematical laws—we project our legal and regulatory systems onto nature.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="callout callout-warning">
                    <h4>⚠️ The Math Debate</h4>
                    <p>Students debated whether mathematics represents <strong>absolute truth</strong> (capital-T Truth) or merely useful <strong>models and tools</strong> for describing observations. This philosophical question mirrors the medieval struggle to reconcile different authorities and systems of knowledge.</p>

            <section id="christianity" class="section">
                <h2>Christianity & The Medieval Model</h2>

                <p>Lewis makes a crucial and somewhat paradoxical claim: <span class="highlight">the medieval cosmology and religion were not easy bedfellows</span>.</p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>The cosmology appears to us in its firmly theistic basis and its ready welcome to the supernatural to be eminently religious. But it is not eminently Christian.</p>
                    <div class="quote-author">— C.S. Lewis, The Discarded Image, p. 18</div>
                </div>

                <p>This creates an important distinction:</p>

                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <div class="concept-card">
                        <h4>🌌 The Model</h4>
                        <p>The cosmological model with its spheres, intelligences, and love-driven motion—used for poetry, allegory, and general cultural understanding.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="concept-card">
                        <h4>✝️ True Christianity</h4>
                        <p>Theology, spiritual advice, and homiletics—the "real deal" that great spiritual writers focused on, often ignoring the model entirely.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="callout">
                    <h4>🔗 Connecting to Bynum</h4>
                    <p>This distinction helps reconcile the comfortable, accessible medieval world of Tolkien's Middle-earth with the disturbing, visceral medieval Christianity explored by Caroline Walker Bynum. <strong>Middle-earth belongs to the model</strong>; Bynum's starving saints belong to <strong>eminently Christian</strong> spirituality.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Silmarillion's Creation Myth</h3>

                <p>Tolkien's creation story exemplifies this medieval sensibility: God creates beings who <em>sing</em> the world into existence—an idea found in Boethius's <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em>, where celestial voices convey philosophy through song.</p>

                <p>This explains Tolkien's fondness for lyric poetry throughout his work. The books don't literally sing, but they practically do, filled with poems that feel like they should have been heard before being read.</p>

                <h2>The Heroic Mode & Its Transformation</h2>

                <p>The lecture explores how World War I fundamentally challenged traditional notions of heroism, and how this crisis appears in both Tolkien's fiction and his scholarship.</p>

                <div class="callout callout-warning">
                    <h4>💀 World War I's Impact</h4>
                    <p>Unlike previous wars, WWI felt <strong>anti-heroic</strong>: machine guns replaced individual combat, soldiers gained inches rather than glory, and an entire generation was slaughtered without producing memorable heroes. As one student noted: "I can't name a single hero from World War I... except the Red Baron."</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Classical Heroism: Beowulf's Death</h3>

                <p>The lecture provides an extended reading from <em>Beowulf</em> to illustrate the classical heroic mode:</p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>Now is the time when I would have wanted to bestow this armor on my own son, had it been my fortune to have fathered an heir... For fifty years, I ruled this nation. No king of any neighboring clan would dare face me with troops... Go now quickly, dearest Wiglaf, under the gray stone where the dragon is laid out. I want to examine that ancient gold, gaze my fill on those garnered jewels. My going will be easier for having seen the treasure.</p>
                    <div class="quote-author">— Beowulf's dying speech</div>
                </div>

                <div class="key-concepts">

                        <h4>⚔️ Heroic Death</h4>
                        <p>The hero dies in battle, slaying a monster, with time for a final speech and the satisfaction of seeing his treasure.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="concept-card">
                        <h4>🎖️ Glory & Praise</h4>
                        <p>The warrior receives gifts, honor, and lasting fame for his deeds.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="concept-card">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>But even Beowulf's ending contains anti-heroic elements: he dies childless, and a wailing woman laments that without him, all the old feuds will resurface. The Swedes and Danes will come. <span class="highlight">The people are doomed.</span></p>

                    <div class="concept-card">

                        <p><strong>Frodo and Sam</strong> — Hobbits of no importance, trying to <em>get rid of</em> treasure rather than gain it, suffering without glory.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Frodo vs. Beowulf</h3>

                <div class="callout">
                    <h4>Key Contrasts</h4>
                    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
                        <li><strong>Treasure:</strong> Beowulf gains it; Frodo destroys it</li>
                        <li><strong>Status:</strong> Beowulf is a king; Frodo is a hobbit</li>
                        <li><strong>Ending:</strong> Beowulf dies gazing at gold; Frodo must leave the Shire</li>
                        <li><strong>Legacy:</strong> Beowulf leaves doom; Frodo leaves hope</li>
                        <li><strong>Recognition:</strong> Beowulf receives praise; Frodo is the "unsung hero"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>Frodo rescues the world for everyone else, but he couldn't rescue it for himself. Some wounds never heal. He saves the world, but he doesn't save what he really wanted to save.</p>
                    <div class="quote-author">— Student observation</div>
                </div>

                <h3>The Christian Parallel</h3>

                <p>Multiple students noted the Christian themes in Frodo's story:</p>

                <div class="discussion-point">
                    <div class="speaker">The Underdog Theme:</div>
                    <p>"It's the whole underdog thing. You have the person that no one else would choose taking on the task—like Mary and Joseph. They get chosen even though they're at the bottom of the barrel. It's always the bottom of the barrel throughout Christianity."</p>
                </div>

                <p>This connects to Bynum's medieval women saints: they are God's ultimate agents <em>precisely because they are low</em>. The unexpected nature of their holiness is the point.</p>

                <h3>Tolkien's Choice</h3>

                <div class="callout callout-success">
                    <h4>✨ The Significance of the Ending</h4>
                    <p>Tolkien puts his cards on the table by how he ends the book. When you have two parallel stories and choose which gets the last word, you're making a powerful statement. The book doesn't end with Aragorn's coronation—it ends with Frodo leaving the Shire and Sam returning home to his family.</p>
                    <p><strong>"Well, I'm back,"</strong> Sam says—and this domestic, humble ending is what Tolkien chose to emphasize.</p>

                </div>

                    <p>Both men saw "the horrors of a particular way of thinking about race." Braudel <em>effaced</em> race by emphasizing geography, climate, and material culture. Tolkien <em>celebrated</em> race through his different peoples (Elves, Men, Hobbits, Dwarves) but struggled with what that meant in the context of Nazi ideology.</p>

                <h2>The Germanic Ideal & Tolkien's Dilemma</h2>

                <p>This section addresses one of the most profound tensions in Tolkien's work: his love of Germanic culture in the age of Hitler.</p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>I have spent most of my life since I was your age studying Germanic matters in the general sense that includes England and Scandinavia. There is a great deal more force and truth than ignorant people imagine in the Germanic ideal. I was much attracted by it as an undergraduate when Hitler was, I suppose, dabbling in paint and had not heard of it.</p>

                <h3>Tolkien's "Burning Private Grudge"</h3>

                <div class="callout">
                    <h4>🔥 Against Hitler</h4>
                    <p>Tolkien wrote that he had "a burning private grudge" against "that ruddy little ignoramus, Adolf Hitler" for:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        <li><strong>Ruining</strong> the noble northern spirit</li>
                        <li><strong>Perverting</strong> Germanic ideals</li>
                        <li><strong>Misapplying</strong> cultural heritage</li>
                        <li><strong>Making forever accursed</strong> what Tolkien had loved and studied</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>Nowhere incidentally was it nobler than in England, nor more early sanctified and Christianized.</p>

                <h3>The 1938 Letter to German Publishers</h3>

                <p>When German publishers asked if Tolkien was "Aryan" before publishing <em>The Hobbit</em>, his response was remarkable:</p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>I am not aware that any of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects, and therefore cannot claim to be Aryan. However, if I am to understand that you are inquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people.</p>
                    <div class="quote-author">— Tolkien, 1938</div>
                </div>

                <p>The letter concluded with this devastating observation:</p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>I have been accustomed to regard my German name with pride and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.</p>
                    <div class="quote-author">— Tolkien, 1938</div>
                </div>

                <div class="callout callout-success">
                    <h4>📅 The Significance of 1938</h4>
                    <p>This letter was written <strong>before</strong> the Sudetenland crisis, at a time when many "reasonable people" claimed they had no idea what was coming. Tolkien clearly understood what was happening in Germany and took a principled stand.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Masculinist World</h3>

                <p>The lecture addresses criticism of Tolkien's male-dominated narratives:</p>

                <div class="discussion-point">
                    <div class="speaker">The Feminist Critique:</div>
                    <p>Tolkien's world is utterly masculinist and violent. It's easy to write a feminist critique pointing out the lack of strong female characters.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="discussion-point">
                    <div class="speaker">Tolkien's Likely Response:</div>
                    <p>"You're right. It's a violent world. That is the world I know. This is the fallen world. It is violent. To the extent we can mitigate that violence—maybe through female influence—that's good. But read the sources. Read Beowulf. It'll tell you women aren't gonna solve this problem."</p>
                </div>

                <p>In <em>Beowulf</em>, the Danish queen is called a "peace weaver" multiple times, yet peace-weaving through marriage alliances consistently fails. The story of Ingeld shows this: married to his enemy's daughter to make peace, he ends up having to choose between killing his wife's father or his own brother.</p>

                    <h3>🎯 Key Takeaways</h3>
                    
                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: var(--text-primary);">Medieval Model vs. Christian Reality</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lewis argues the medieval cosmological model and true Christian theology were separate domains</li>
                        <li>The "comfortable" medieval world (spheres, humors, planetary influences) was the <em>model</em></li>
                        <li>The "disturbing" medieval Christianity (Bynum's saints) was the <em>real deal</em></li>
                        <li>Tolkien's Middle-earth belongs to the model; it's not "eminently Christian"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: var(--text-primary);">The Transformation of Heroism</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Classical heroism (Beowulf): aristocratic warriors dying gloriously in battle, gaining treasure and fame</li>
                        <li>WWI destroyed this model: machine guns, trenches, mass slaughter without individual glory</li>
                        <li>Tolkien's response: the anti-hero (Frodo/Sam) who suffers without recognition, destroys rather than gains treasure</li>
                        <li>Christian parallel: the underdog chosen by God, the low made high</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: var(--text-primary);">The Germanic Ideal Crisis</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tolkien devoted his life to studying Germanic culture and literature</li>
                        <li>Hitler's appropriation of Germanic ideals created a "burning private grudge"</li>
                        <li>Tolkien saw Hitler as ruining, perverting, and making "forever accursed" what he loved</li>
                        <li>His 1938 letter shows he understood Nazi ideology early and took a principled stand</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: var(--text-primary);">Intellectual Context</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Both Tolkien and Lewis were WWI veterans shaped by trauma</li>
                        <li>Both created mental worlds they could control, though still violent</li>
                        <li>Similar to Braudel: intellectuals responding to "a world gone mad" over race</li>
                        <li>Their fiction and scholarship are inseparable—both are responses to historical crisis</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: var(--text-primary);">Literary Significance</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tolkien wrote fiction as pseudo-history (appendices, languages, chronicles)</li>
                        <li>The line between fiction and history is deliberately blurred</li>
                        <li>His work has "enormous appeal" because it creates a believable alternate world</li>
                        <li>The ending matters: Tolkien chose the anti-heroic story (Frodo/Sam) over the heroic one (Aragorn)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="callout" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    <h4>💭 Final Reflection</h4>
                    <p>These are "very intelligent men struggling with a world that is somewhat incomprehensible to them because it's gone mad in some very real sense." What they write—whether fiction or history—must somehow deal with living in a world gone mad, particularly over questions of race.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Tolkien was a mensch</strong> in the truest sense of that word. His intellectual and moral courage in 1938 demonstrates that it was possible to see what was happening and take a stand, even when many others claimed ignorance.</p>
